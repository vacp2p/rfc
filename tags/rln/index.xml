      <description>Abstract # This spec integrates Interep into the RLN spec. Interep is a group management protocol that allows for the creation of groups of users and the management of their membership. It is used to manage the membership of the RLN group.
Interep ties in web2 identities with reputation, and sorts the users into groups based on their reputation score. For example, a GitHub user with over 100 followers is considered to have &amp;ldquo;gold&amp;rdquo; reputation.</description>
