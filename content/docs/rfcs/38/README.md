# Abstract

The Logos organization seeks to research, develop, and promote the
technological infrastructure necessary for the creation of "Network State":  

We sketch the needs of Logos for the ability to provide a consensus
mechanism for communities upon which consensual meaning can be arbitrated.

# Background 

## Commmon Interest Communities

We posit our users as members of a Common Interest Community, akin to
the affinity groups in network states.  

Such a community has the following characteristics:

We expect the number of participants in a given community to vary
widely from the smallest of around 10 nodes to contemporary "blockchain
limits" of around 10000 nodes.

## Requirements 

# Consensus

We seek a layered approach to creating mechanisms for consensus: a
low-level binary consensus protocol upon which we can create varying
execution layers.

## Probabilistic Binary Consensus

The Snow* family of agorithims quickly finalize a binary consensus in
a leaderless manner with O(n) message a

## Execution Layer

# Semantics




# Problematic

      If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to
      man as it is: Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees
      all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.
          -- William Blake "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell"
          
      To await and prepare for this moment is to manipulate
      information not as the last shock wave whose significance
      escapes everyone, but as the first repercussion of an act still
      to come.
          -- Raoul Vaneigm "Basic Banalities"
      

## In Media Res

We begin--as all worthwhile journeys begin--in the middle of things,
desiring to communicate a whole without knowing the exact shape of the
future we have glimpsed in moments of revelation, which while
untethered from currently existing reality, provides an intoxicating
fever dream of a more desirable future.

And the dream is this: one can do blockchain without Nakamoto
consensus.  One can have a leaderless consensus, upon which a
totalizing view of transactions can be constructed.

# Consensus
# Interoperability 
## Wire Formats Specification / Syntax
At this point, we do not commit to a syntax but rather to a semantics
of message exchange between nodes
# Colophon
## In Media Res

As such, this RFC is expected to be superseded by a more rigorous
structure
