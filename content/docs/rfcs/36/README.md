# Introduction

Native applications that wish to integrate Waku may not be able to use nwaku and its JSON RPC API due to constraints
on packaging, performance or executables.

An alternative is to link existing Waku implementation as a static or dynamic library in their application.

This specification describes the C API that SHOULD be implemented by native Waku library and that SHOULD be used to
consume them.

# Design requirements

The API should be generic enough, so:

- it can be implemented by both nwaku and go-waku C-Bindings,
- it can be consumed from a variety of languages such as C#, Kotlin, Swift, Rust, C++, etc.

The selected format to pass data to and from the API is `JSON`.

It has been selected due to its widespread usage and easiness of use. Other alternatives MAY replace it in the future (C
structure, protobuf) if it brings limitations that need to be lifted.

# The API

## General

### `WakuCallBack` type

All the API functions require passing callbacks which will be executed depending on the result of the execution result.
These callbacks are defined as
```c
typedef void (*WakuCallBack) (const char* msg, size_t len_0);
```
With `msg` containing a `\0` terminated string, and `len_0` the length of this string. The format of the data sent to these callbacks
will depend on the function being executed. The data can be characters, numeric or json.

### Status Codes
The API functions return an integer with status codes depending on the execution result. The following status codes are defined:
- `0` - Success
- `1` - Error
- `2` - Missing callback

### `JsonMessage` type

A Waku Message in JSON Format:

```ts
{
    payload: string;
    contentTopic: string;
    version: number;
    timestamp: number;
}
```

Fields:

- `payload`: base64 encoded payload, [`waku_utils_base64_encode`](#extern-char-waku_utils_base64_encodechar-data) can be used for this.
- `contentTopic`: The content topic to be set on the message.
- `version`: The Waku Message version number.
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp in nanoseconds.

### `DecodedPayload` type

A payload once decoded, used when a received Waku Message is encrypted:

```ts
interface DecodedPayload {
    pubkey?: string;
    signature?: string;
    data: string;
    padding: string;
  }
```

Fields:

- `pubkey`: Public key that signed the message (optional), hex encoded with `0x` prefix,
- `signature`: Message signature (optional), hex encoded with `0x` prefix,
- `data`: Decrypted message payload base64 encoded,
- `padding`: Padding base64 encoded.

### `FilterSubscription` type

The criteria to create subscription to a light node in JSON Format:

```ts
{
    contentFilters: ContentFilter[];
    pubsubTopic: string?;
}
```

Fields:

- `contentFilters`: Array of [`ContentFilter`](#contentfilter-type) being subscribed to / unsubscribed from.
- `topic`: Optional pubsub topic.


### `ContentFilter` type

```ts
{
    contentTopic: string;
}
```

Fields:

- `contentTopic`: The content topic of a Waku message.

### `StoreQuery` type

Criteria used to retrieve historical messages

```ts
interface StoreQuery {
    pubsubTopic?: string;
    contentFilters?: ContentFilter[];
    startTime?: number;
    endTime?: number;
    pagingOptions?: PagingOptions
  }
```

Fields:

- `pubsubTopic`: The pubsub topic on which messages are published.
- `contentFilters`: Array of [`ContentFilter`](#contentfilter-type) to query for historical messages,
- `startTime`: The inclusive lower bound on the timestamp of queried messages. This field holds the Unix epoch time in nanoseconds.
- `endTime`: The inclusive upper bound on the timestamp of queried messages. This field holds the Unix epoch time in nanoseconds.
- `pagingOptions`: Paging information in [`PagingOptions`](#pagingoptions-type) format.

### `StoreResponse` type

The response received after doing a query to a store node:

```ts
interface StoreResponse {
    messages: JsonMessage[];
    pagingOptions?: PagingOptions;
  }
```
Fields:

- `messages`: Array of retrieved historical messages in [`JsonMessage`](#jsonmessage-type) format.
- `pagingOption`: Paging information in [`PagingOptions`](#pagingoptions-type) format from which to resume further historical queries

### `PagingOptions` type

```ts
interface PagingOptions {
    pageSize: number;
    cursor?: Index;
    forward: bool;
  }
```
Fields:

- `pageSize`: Number of messages to retrieve per page.
- `cursor`: Message Index from which to perform pagination. If not included and forward is set to true, paging will be performed from the beginning of the list. If not included and forward is set to false, paging will be performed from the end of the list.
- `forward`:  `true` if paging forward, `false` if paging backward

### `Index` type

```ts
interface Index {
    digest: string;
    receiverTime: number;
    senderTime: number;
    pubsubTopic: string;
  }
```

Fields:

- `digest`: Hash of the message at this [`Index`](#index-type).
- `receiverTime`: UNIX timestamp in nanoseconds at which the message at this [`Index`](#index-type) was received.
- `senderTime`: UNIX timestamp in nanoseconds at which the message is generated by its sender.
- `pubsubTopic`: The pubsub topic of the message at this [`Index`](#index-type).

## Events

Asynchronous events require a callback to be registered.
An example of an asynchronous event that might be emitted is receiving a message.
When an event is emitted, this callback will be triggered receiving a JSON string of type `JsonSignal`.

### `JsonSignal` type

```ts
{
    type: string;
    event: any;
}
```

Fields:

- `type`: Type of signal being emitted. Currently, only `message` is available.
- `event`: Format depends on the type of signal.

For example:

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "event": {
    "pubsubTopic": "/waku/2/default-waku/proto",
    "messageId": "0x6496491e40dbe0b6c3a2198c2426b16301688a2daebc4f57ad7706115eac3ad1",
    "wakuMessage": {
      "payload": "TODO",
      "contentTopic": "/my-app/1/notification/proto",
      "version": 1,
      "timestamp": 1647826358000000000
    }
