The `17/WAKU-RLN-RELAY` protocol is an extension of `11/WAKU-RELAY` which additionally provides spam-protection using [Rate Limiting Nullifiers (RLN)](/spec/32). 

The security objective is to contain spam activity in a GossipSub network by enforcing a global messaging rate to all the peers.
Peers that violate the messaging rate are considered spammer, financially punished and removed from the system. 


**Protocol identifier***: `/vac/waku/waku-rln-relay/2.0.0-alpha1`

# Motivation

In open and anonymous p2p messaging networks, one big problem is spam-resistance. 
Existing solutions, such as Whisperâ€™s proof of work are computationally expensive hence not suitable for resource-limited nodes. 
Other reputation-based approaches might not be desirable, due to issues around arbitrary exclusion and privacy.

We augment the [`11/WAKU2-RELAY`](/spec/11) protocol with a novel construct of [RLN](/spec/32) to enable an efficient and economic spam prevention mechanism suitable for the resource-constrained peers.


# Flow
The messaging rate is set to 1 per `epoch`, 
where `epoch` indicates the number of `T` seconds elapsed since Unix epoch event.
The value of `T` is application dependent.
Peers subscribed to a spam-protected `pubsubTopic` are only allowed to send one message per `epoch`
(messaging rate MAY be enforced for `WakuMessages` with a specific `contetTopic` published on a `pubsubTopic`, but that is an implementation choice).

## SetUp and Registration
Peers subscribed to a specific `pubsubTopic` form a [rln group](/spec/32).
<!-- will later provide a link to the rln group definition in the rln rfc -->
Peers MUST be registered to the rln group to be able to publish message.
Registration is moderated through a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. 
Each peer has an [rln key pair](/spec/32) denoted by `sk`  and `pk`.
The `sk` is a secret data and MUST be persisted securely by the peer.
The state of the membership contract contains the list of registered members' public identity keys i.e., `pk`s. 
For the registration, a peer creates a transaction that invokes the registration function of the contract via which registers its `pk` in the group. 
The transaction also transfers  `v` amount of ether to the contract to be staked. 
`v` is a system parameter.
The peer who has the "private key" `sk` associated with a registered `pk` would be able to withdraw a portion `p` of that staked fund by providing a valid proof. <!-- a secure way to prove the possession of a pk is yet under discussion, maybe via commit and reveal -->
`p` is also a system parameter.

Note that  `sk` is initially only known to its owning peer however, it may get exposed to other peers in case the owner attempts spamming the system i.e., sending more than one message per `epoch`.
An overview of registration is illustrated in Figure 1.

## Publishing

In order to publish at a given `epoch`, the publishing peer proceeds based on the regular [`11/WAKU2-RELAY`](/spec/11) protocol.  
However, in order to protect against spamming, each `WakuMessage` (which is wrapped inside the `data` field of a PubSub message) MUST carry a [`RateLimitProof`](##RateLimitProof) with the following fields. 

The `proof` field which is a zero-knowledge proof signifying that the publishing peer is a  registered member, and she has not exceeded the messaging rate at the given `epoch`. 
The proof generation relies on the knowledge of two pieces of private information i.e., `sk` and `authPath`.
The `authPath` is a subset of Merkle tree nodes by which a peer can prove the inclusion of its `pk` in the group. <!-- TODO refer to RLN rfc for authPath def -->
The proof generation also requires a set of public inputs which are: the Merkle tree root `merkle_root`, the current `epoch` and the message for which the proof is going to be generated. 
In `17/WAKU-RLN-RELAY`, the message is the concatenation of `WakuMessage`'s  `payload` filed and its `contentTopic` i.e., `payload||contentTopic`. 
For more details about the proof generation, please check [RLN](/spec/32)


The `merkle_root` contains the root of the Merkle tree.

The `epoch` represents the current epoch.

The `nullifier` is an internal nullifier acting as a fingerprint which allows specifying whether two messages are published by the same peer during the same `epoch`.
The `nullifier` is a deterministic value derived from `sk` and `epoch` therefore any two messages issued by the same peer (i.e., sing the same `sk`) for the same `epoch` are guaranteed to have identical `nullifier`s.

The `share_x` and `share_y` can be seen as partial disclosure of peer's `sk` for the intended `epoch`.
These shares are created using [Shamir secret sharing scheme](/spec/32). 
Given two such tuples with identical `nullifier` but distinct `share_x`, `share_y` results in full disclosure of peer's `sk` and hence getting access to the peer's staked fund in the membership contract.



## Group  Synchronization

Proof generation relies on the knowledge of Merkle tree root `merkle_root` and `authPath` which both require access to the membership Merkle tree. 
Getting access to the Merkle tree can be done in various way. 
One way is that all the peers construct the tree locally.
This can be done by listening to the registration and deletion events emitted by the membership contract.

One important security consideration is that peers MUST make sure they always use the most recent Merkle tree root in their proof generation.
The reason is that using an old root can allow inference about the index of the user `pk` in the membership tree hence compromising user privacy and breaking message unlinkability.

<!-- `sk`  and `authPath`  are secret data and MUST be permanently and locally stored by the peer.  -->

<!-- The `proof` is embedded inside the `data` field of the PubSub message, which, in the [11/WAKU2-RELAY](/spec/11) protocol, corresponds to the [14/WAKU2-MESSAGE](/spec/14).  -->

<!-- To construct `authPath`, peers need to locally store a Merkle tree based on the list of public keys available in the state of membership contract. 
Peers need to keep the tree updated with the recent state of the group.   -->


<!-- The tree `root` can be obtained from the locally maintained Merkle tree.
The proof generation results in the following data items which are encoded inside the `proof`:  
1. `share_x`
2. `share_y`
3. `nullifier`
4. `zkSNARKs`

The preceding values as well as the tree `root` (based on which the proof is generated) are encoded inside the `proof` as `|zkSNARKs<256>|root<32>|epoch<32>|share_x<32>|share_y<32>|nullifier<32>|`.
The numbers enclosed in angle brackets indicate the bit length of the corresponding data item.
The tuple of (`nullifier`, `share_x`, `share_y`)  can be seen as partial disclosure of peer's `sk` for the intended `epoch`.
Given two such tuples with identical `nullifier` but distinct `share_x`, `share_y` results in full disclosure of peer's `sk` and hence burning the associated deposit.
Note that the `nullifier` is a deterministic value derived from `sk` and `epoch` therefore any two messages issued by the same peer (i.e., sing the same `sk`) for the same `epoch` are guaranteed to have identical `nullifier`s.

Note that the `authPath` of each peer depends on the current status of the registration tree (hence changes when new peers register).
As such, it is recommended (and necessary for anonymity) that the publisher updates her `authPath` based on the latest status of the group and attempts the proof using her updated `authPath`. -->


## Routing

Upon the receipt of a PubSub message, the routing peer parses the `data` field as a `WakuMessage` and gets access to the `RateLimitProof` field.  
The peer then validates the `RateLimitProof`  as explained next.

**Epoch Validation**
If the `epoch` attached to the message has a more than a threshold difference with the routing peer's current `epoch` then the message is discarded and considered invalid.
This is to prevent a newly registered peer spamming the system by messaging for all the past epochs. 

**Proof Verification**
The routing peers MUST check whether the zero-knowledge proof `proof` is valid.
It does so by running the zk verification algorithm as explained in [RLN](/spec/32). 
If `proof` is invalid then the message is discarded. 

**Spam detection**
In order to enable local spam detection and slashing, routing peers MUST record the `nullifier`, `share_x`, and `share_y` of incoming messages if not discarded i.e., not found spam or with invalid proof or epoch.
To do so, the peer checks whether a message with an identical `nullifier` has already been relayed. 
1. If such message exists and its `share_x` and `share_y` components are different from the incoming message, then slashing takes place.
That is, the peer uses the  `share_x` and `share_y`  of the new message and the  `share'_x` and `share'_y` of the old record to reconstruct the `sk` of the message owner.
The `sk` than can be used to withdraw the reward i.e., the deposit of the message owner from the membership contract.
2. If the `share_x` and `share_y` fields of the previously relayed message is identical to the incoming message, then the message is a duplicate and shall be discarded.
3. If none found, then the message gets relayed.

An overview of the routing procedure and slashing is provided in Figure 2.

# Payloads

Payloads are protobuf messages implemented using [protocol buffers v3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
Nodes MAY extend the  [14/WAKU2-MESSAGE](/spec/14) with a `rate_limit_proof` field to indicate that their message is not a spam.

```diff 

syntax = "proto3";

message RateLimitProof {
  bytes proof = 1;
  bytes merkle_root = 2;
  bytes epoch = 3;
  bytes share_x = 4;
  bytes share_y = 5;
  bytes nullifier = 6;
}

message WakuMessage {
  bytes payload = 1;
  string contentTopic = 2;
  uint32 version = 3;
  double timestamp = 4;
+ RateLimitProof rate_limit_proof = 21;
}

```
## WakuMessage

`rate_limit_proof` holds the information required to prove that the message owner has not exceeded the message rate limit.
 
## RateLimitProof

The `proof` field is an array of 256 bytes and carries the zkSNARK proof as explained in the [Publishing process](##Publishing).
The proof asserts that:
1. The message publisher is the current member of the group i.e., her/his identity commitment key is part of the membership group Merkle tree with the root `merkle_root`.
2. `share_x` and `share_y`  are correctly computed.
3. The `nullifier` is constructed correctly.

Other fields of the `RateLimitProof` message are the public inputs to the [rln circuit](/spec/32) and used for the generation of the `proof`.

The `merkle_root` is an array of 32 bytes in little-endian order which holds the root of membership group Merkle tree at the time of publishing the message.

The `epoch` is an array of 32 bytes in little-endian order that represents the epoch in which the message is published.

`share_x` and `share_y` are shares of the user's identity key.
`share_x` is an array of 32 bytes and contains the hash of the `WakuMessage`'s `payload` concatenated with its `contentTopic`. 
<!-- We may include other fields in the hash if necessary-->
`share_y` is also an array of 32 bytes which is calculated using [Shamir secret sharing scheme](/spec/32).

The `nullifier` is the internal nullifier encoded as an array of 32 bytes.
