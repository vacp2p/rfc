# Abstract


# Background / Rationale / Motivation

This section serves as an introduction providing background information and a motivation/rationale for why the specified protocol is useful.

# Theory / Semantics

This section SHOULD explain in detail how the proposed protocol works.
It may touch on the wire format where necessary for the explanation.
This section MAY also specify endpoint behaviour when receiving specific messages, e.g. the behaviour of certain caches etc.

# Wire Format Specification / Syntax

This section SHOULD not contain explanations of semantics and focus on concisely defining the wire format.
Implementations MUST adhere to these exact formats to interoperate with other implementations.
It is fine, if parts of the previous section that touch on the wire format are repeated.
The purpose of this section is having a concise definition of what an implementation sends and accepts.
Parts that are not specified here are considered implementation details. Implementors are free to decide on how to implement these details.
An optional *implementation suggestions* section may provide suggestions on how to approach implementation details, and, if available, point to existing implementations for reference.
