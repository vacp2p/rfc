This is an informational spec that show cases the concept of adaptive nodes.

# Node types - a continuum

We can look at node types as a continuum, from more restricted to less restricted, fewer resources to more resources.

# Node protocol selection

Each node can choose which protocols to support, depending on its resources and goals.

# Waku network visualization

We can better visualize the network with some illustrative examples.

## Topology and topics

The first one shows an example topology with different PubSub topics for the relay protocol.

## Node Cross Section

This one shows a cross-section of nodes in different dimensions and shows how the connections look different for different protocols.
