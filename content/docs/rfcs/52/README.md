# Abstract

This document lists static shard flag index assignments (see [51/WAKU2-RELAY-SHARDING](/spec/51/).

# Background

Similar to the [IANA port allocation](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml),
this document lists static shard index assignments (see [51/WAKU2-RELAY-SHARDING](/spec/51/).

# Assingment Process

> *Note*: Future versions of this document will specify the assignment process.
