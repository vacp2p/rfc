# Abstract

`WakuRelay` is part of the gossip domain for Waku. It is a thin layer on top of GossipSub.

**Protocol identifier***: `/vac/waku/relay/2.0.0-beta2`

## Security Requirements

<!-- In this part, we analyze the security of the  `relay` protocol concerning data confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and anonymity. This is to enable users of this protocol to make informed decision about all the secuirty properties that can or can not achieve by deploying `relay` protocol. -->

- Personally identifiable information (PII): PII indicates any piece of data that can be used to uniquely identify a Peer. For example, the signature verification key, and the hash of one's IP address are unique for each peer and hence count as PII.

- Message Publisher Anonymity: This propery indicates that no adversarial entity is able to link a published `Message` to its origin i.e., the peer. Note that this feature also implies the unlinkability of the publisher to its published topic ID, this is because  `Message` contains the `topicIDs` as well.

- Topic Subscriber Anonymity: This feature stands for the inability of any adversarial entity from linking a peer to its subscribed topic IDs. 


## Adversarial Model
- Honest but Curious / static adversary: Throught this spec we consider an Honest but Curious adversarial model (static adversary interchangebly. That is, an adversarial entity may attempt to collect infromation from other peers (i.e., being curious) in order to succedd in its attack but it does so without violating protocol definitions and instructions (is honest), namely, it does follow the protocol specifications. 


## Wire Specification

We are using protobuf RPC messages between peers. Here's what the protobuf messages looks like, as defined in the PubSub interface. Please see [PubSub interface spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/README.md) for more details.

In this section we specify two things how WakuSub is using these messages.

## Protobuf

```protobuf
message RPC {
  repeated SubOpts subscriptions = 1;
  repeated Message publish = 2;

  message SubOpts {
    optional bool subscribe = 1;
    optional string topicid = 2;
  }

message Message {
  optional string from = 1;
  optional bytes data = 2;
  optional bytes seqno = 3;
  repeated string topicIDs = 4;
  optional bytes signature = 5;
  optional bytes key = 6;
}
```

WakuSub does not currently use the `ControlMessage` defined in GossipSub.
However, later versions will add likely add this capability.

`TopicDescriptor` as defined in the PubSub interface spec is not currently used.

## RPC

These are messages sent to directly connected peers. They SHOULD NOT be
gossiped. See section below on how the fields work.

## Message

The `from` field MAY indicate which peer is publishing the message.

The `data` field MUST be filled out with a `WakuMessage`. See the [Waku Message](waku-message.md) spec for more details.

The `seqno` field MAY be used to provide a linearly increasing number. See PubSub spec for more details.

The `topicIDs` field MUST contain the topics that a message is being published on.

The `signature` field MAY contain the signature of the message, thus providing authentication of the message. See PubSub spec for more details.

The `key` field MAY be present and relates to signing. See PubSub spec for more details.


## SubOpts

To do topic subscription management, we MAY send updates to our peers. If we do so, then:

The `subscribe` field MUST contain a boolean, where 1 means subscribe and 0 means unsubscribe to a topic.

The `topicid` field MUST contain the topic.


## Security Analysis
- In order to accomdoate message anonymity, `relay` protocol follows `NoSign` policy due to which the `from`, `signature` and `key` fields of the `Message` MUST be left empty by the message publisher. The reason is that each of these three fields alone count as PII for the message author.

<!--
TODO: Don't quite understand this scenario [key field], to clarify. Wouldn't it always be in `from`?
> The key field contains the signing key when it cannot be inlined in the source peer ID. When present, it must match the peer ID. -->

Re topicid:
NOTE: This doesn't appear to be documented in PubSub spec, upstream?
