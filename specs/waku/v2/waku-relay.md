# Abstract

`WakuRelay` is part of the gossip domain for Waku. It is a thin layer on top of GossipSub.

**Protocol identifier***: `/vac/waku/relay/2.0.0-beta2`

## Wire Specification

We are using protobuf RPC messages between peers. Here's what the protobuf messages looks like, as defined in the PubSub interface. Please see [PubSub interface spec](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/README.md) for more details.

In this section we specify two things how WakuSub is using these messages.

## Protobuf

```protobuf
message RPC {
  repeated SubOpts subscriptions = 1;
  repeated Message publish = 2;

  message SubOpts {
    optional bool subscribe = 1;
    optional string topicid = 2;
  }

message Message {
  optional string from = 1;
  optional bytes data = 2;
  optional bytes seqno = 3;
  repeated string topicIDs = 4;
  optional bytes signature = 5;
  optional bytes key = 6;
}
```

WakuSub does not currently use the `ControlMessage` defined in GossipSub.
However, later versions will add likely add this capability.

`TopicDescriptor` as defined in the PubSub interface spec is not currently used.

## RPC

These are messages sent to directly connected peers. They SHOULD NOT be
gossiped. See section below on how the fields work.

## Message

The `from` field MAY indicate which peer is publishing the message.

The `data` field MUST be filled out with a `WakuMessage`. See the [Waku Message](waku-message.md) spec for more details.

The `seqno` field MAY be used to provide a linearly increasing number. See PubSub spec for more details.

The `topicIDs` field MUST contain the topics that a message is being published on.

The `signature` field MAY contain the signature of the message, thus providing authentication of the message. See PubSub spec for more details.

The `key` field MAY be present and relates to signing. See PubSub spec for more details.


## SubOpts

To do topic subscription management, we MAY send updates to our peers. If we do so, then:

The `subscribe` field MUST contain a boolean, where 1 means subscribe and 0 means unsubscribe to a topic.

The `topicid` field MUST contain the topic.

## Signature Policy

The `StrictNoSign` option MUST be used.

<!--
TODO: Don't quite understand this scenario [key field], to clarify. Wouldn't it always be in `from`?
> The key field contains the signing key when it cannot be inlined in the source peer ID. When present, it must match the peer ID. -->

Re topicid:
NOTE: This doesn't appear to be documented in PubSub spec, upstream?
