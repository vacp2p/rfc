## Abstract

@TODO

<!-- In this specification, we describe a method to provide consistency through various means as well as modifying synchronization of [MVDS](./README.md). This specification mainly describes a format for the header field of an [MVDS message](./README.md#payloads) that modifies the functionality of MVDS. -->

## Format

The meta data field is used to convey various information on a message and how it MUST be handled.

```protobuf
package vac.mvds;

message MetaData {
  
  enum Persistence {
    PERSISTENT = 0;
    EPHEMERAL = 1;
  }
  
  repeated bytes parents = 7001;
  optional int64 sequence = 7002;
  optional bool ack = 7003 [default = true];
  optional Persistence persistence = 7004 [default = PERSISTENT]
}
```

We MAY transmit a `MetaData` message by extending the MVDS [message](./README.md#payloads) with a `meta_data` field.

```diff
message Message {
+ MetaData meta_data = 6000;
  bytes group_id = 6001;
  int64 timestamp = 6002;
  bytes body = 6003;
}
```
### Fields

| Name          |  Description                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `parents`     |  contains a list of parent [`message identifiers`](./README.md#payloads). |
| `sequence`    |  sequence number of the message.                                          |
| `ack`         |  contains a flag whether a message needs to be acknowledged or not.       |
| `persistence` |  dictates whether a message's storage is ephemeral or persistent.         |

## Usage

The flags provided through the `MetaData` message are either informational or configurational. Informational fields MAY be used by a node, configurational fields MUST be recognized and the nodes behavior MUST change accordingly.

### Information

Below are the list of informational flags and what they MAY be used for by a node.

@TODO

### Behavior

Below are a list of the behavioral flags and how they modify node behavior.

#### `ack`

When the `ack` flag is set to `true`, a node MUST acknowledge when they have received and processed  a message. If it is set to `false`, it MUST not send any acknowledgement.

#### `persistance`
